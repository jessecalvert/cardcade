TODO

- game
	- more abilities
	- record a history, and be able to view what has happened in the game so far
	- define cards in a text file
		- do we need to use some kind of scripting language to define what cards do?
		- most cards just fiddle with stats, more complicated cards like Swap and Taunt are problems.
	- better ui for cards
		- fancy arrows
		- make it clear what is selected/targeted/etc.

- platform layer
	- multiplayer over internet
	- add audio
	- get renderer/shader/asset hotloading back
	- platform code hot reloading
		- save memory, start a new process with the new code, then exit?
			- can we keep debugging if we start a new process?

- assets
	- prefetch assets
		- we are waiting until the moment we need the asset before requesting them.

- AI
	- anything?

- debug
	- More UI things
		- view vectors and matrices better
			- graphical view
		- modify more types
	- How do you time things happening on the GPU?
		- probably could use glFlush(), but it would slow everything down.
	- More memory_region data.
		- debug_event for allocations/deallocations, temporary_memory, ... ?
	- a scrollbar? things are getting crowded.
	- console
		- input
			- input capture
			- register functions that can be run from the console
				- typechecking, varargs, casts, composition
		- scroll up in history
		- Colors per character or word
			- escape characters?
		- message types
			- pop up automatically on errors?
	- FreeTimeBlockRecursive
		- remove recursion, then remember to reduce stack size.

MISC:

- new matrix format
	- make simd-izable
	- most matrices are mostly zeros, mults and inverses could be easier if
		we could inspect this first.

- Simple preprocessor
	- infinite loops with some syntax errors.
		- ';' instead of ',' in enum.
	- doesn't look at the platform layer or renderer!
	- ast?
	- process console commands
